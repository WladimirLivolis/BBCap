# projetoRNP

In this project, we will be investigating new non-cooperative active measurement techniques,
aiming the development of algorithms for estimating network performance metrics (e.g., bandwidth,
delays, losses and availability) from remote machines, connected to the Internet through broadband
networks, without privileges of access to the target machine. The expected result is a robust
algorithm, implemented in an open source tool, which will be made available in a public repository
on the Internet. Further, it is expected conducting extensive tests, real experiments and case 
studies.
